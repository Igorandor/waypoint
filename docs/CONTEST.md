The application includes English installation instructions and a written demonstration walkthrough. Original source code is MIT licensed and ready for a public GitHub/GitLab repository. This local preparation does not constitute publication or submission to Open Exchange.

## Technology bonuses

The [published technology bonus list](https://community.intersystems.com/post/technology-bonuses-intersystems-programming-contest-build-your-own-management-portal) was reviewed. Waypoint uses Docker and Embedded Python for a concrete purpose: native host telemetry and bounded log reads.

No claim is made for online hosting, published IPM packages, community ideas, articles, YouTube videos, first-time participation or reported vendor bugs. These require separate completed actions or eligibility checks.

## Before publishing

1. Choose the public repository and push this directory as its root.
2. Keep `.env`, test credentials for non-demo systems and generated runtime data out of the repository.
3. Add the real author's Developer Community profile to the Open Exchange submission. If submitted as a team, add all team members' profile links to the README.
4. Use the description below and the README walkthrough for the application listing.
5. Review the [general terms](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/markdown?url=/assets/doc/contest-terms.md), publish the application on Open Exchange, then apply to the contest using the [submission guide](https://docs.openexchange.intersystems.com/contest/apply/). The announcement states a submission deadline of **September 27, 2026, 23:59 EST**; verify the current deadline in the organizer's interface.

### Suggested Open Exchange description

Waypoint guides maintenance procedures in InterSystems IRIS. Record the starting state of an application or task schedule, perform each step explicitly and restore that state after maintenance. Interrupted operations remain visible for review. Versioned procedures also support read-only observations and manual checklists. Handover reports include recorded results and unfinished work. The repository includes Docker installation instructions and administration tools for applications, access, secrets, tasks, host resources and logs.

## Current review status

See [the latest authorization and readiness review](CONTEST_SECURITY_REVIEW.md). Public repository publication, the Open Exchange listing, participant eligibility and organizer acceptance remain unconfirmed. The earlier Harbor application foundation has been replaced by separate implementations. Retained references and validation support are disclosed in [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md); separate acceptance still belongs to the organizer.

## Original idea and current walkthrough

The [original project idea](../IDEA.md) and the additional product-specific walkthrough in [README](../README.md) describe the current independent release. The official [contest page](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/contest/48), read September 26, lists the submission deadline as September 27, 2026, 23:59 EST. It also identifies complexity, clarity of instructions, developer experience, applicability and usability as judging criteria. No acceptance or bonus award is implied.

## Video and online-demo preparation

A music-only walkthrough, English captions and upload text are prepared; see [VIDEO.md](VIDEO.md). They have not been published. The owner chose to skip cloud hosting; see [ONLINE_DEMO.md](ONLINE_DEMO.md). Do not count a local video file or local server as an awarded bonus.
