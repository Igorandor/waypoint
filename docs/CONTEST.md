The application includes English installation instructions and a written demonstration walkthrough. Original source code is MIT licensed and published at [Igorandor/waypoint](https://github.com/Igorandor/waypoint). The Open Exchange application was sent for approval with Submit to Contest selected on September 28, 2026 (Europe/Warsaw). The application is [published on Open Exchange](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/package/Waypoint) and listed among the registered applications in contest 48. Later description updates may still await moderation.

## Technology bonuses

The [published technology bonus list](https://community.intersystems.com/post/technology-bonuses-intersystems-programming-contest-build-your-own-management-portal) was reviewed. Waypoint uses Docker and Embedded Python for a concrete purpose: native host telemetry and bounded log reads.

The video is available through the link in [VIDEO.md](VIDEO.md). No bonus award is assumed. Online hosting, community ideas, first-time participation and reported vendor bugs are not claimed.

## Submission follow-up

1. Registration is visible on [contest 48](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/contest/48); check any subsequent moderator feedback.
2. Check subsequent Community moderator feedback; the article URL is already attached to the application.
3. Keep credentials and generated runtime data out of future commits.
4. Confirm awarded bonuses with the organizer; upload or submission alone does not establish an award.

### Suggested Open Exchange description

Waypoint guides maintenance procedures in InterSystems IRIS. Record the starting state of an application or task schedule, perform each step explicitly and restore that state after maintenance. Interrupted operations remain visible for review. Versioned procedures also support read-only observations and manual checklists. Handover reports include recorded results and unfinished work. The repository includes Docker installation instructions and administration tools for applications, access, secrets, tasks, host resources and logs.

## Current review status

See [the latest authorization and readiness review](CONTEST_SECURITY_REVIEW.md). The repository and Open Exchange application are public, and the application appears on the official contest list. Participant eligibility and organizer acceptance remain the organizer’s decision.

## Original idea and current walkthrough

The [original project idea](../IDEA.md) and the additional product-specific walkthrough in [README](../README.md) describe the application. The official [contest page](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/contest/48), read September 26, lists the submission deadline as September 27, 2026, 23:59 EST. It also identifies complexity, clarity of instructions, developer experience, applicability and usability as judging criteria. No acceptance or bonus award is implied.

## Video and online-demo preparation

The [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75ABhoRBS-4) is published as unlisted with English captions and CC0 music; see [VIDEO.md](VIDEO.md). The owner chose to skip cloud hosting; see [ONLINE_DEMO.md](ONLINE_DEMO.md). Do not count a local video file or local server as an awarded bonus.

## IPM deployment

Version 1.1.0 includes a complete IPM package: the frontend, bundled gateway dependencies and native extension. Node.js remains a prerequisite. See [installation and lifecycle checks](WAYPOINT_IPM.md). Public registry availability will be recorded after Open Exchange publication; the organizer determines bonus eligibility.
